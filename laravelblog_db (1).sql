Lorem Ipsum &egrave; considerato il testo segnaposto standard sin dal sedicesimo secolo, quando un anonimo tipografo prese una cassetta di caratteri e li assembl&ograve; per preparare un testo campione. &Egrave; sopravvissuto non solo a pi&ugrave; di cinque secoli, ma anche al passaggio alla videoimpaginazione, pervenendoci sostanzialmente inalterato. Fu reso popolare, negli anni &rsquo;60, con la diffusione dei fogli di caratteri trasferibili &ldquo;Letraset&rdquo;, che contenevano passaggi del Lorem Ipsum, e pi&ugrave; recentemente da software di impaginazione come Aldus PageMaker, che includeva versioni del Lorem Ipsum.</p>\r\n<h2>Da dove viene?</h2>\r\n<p>Al contrario di quanto si pensi, Lorem Ipsum non &egrave; semplicemente una sequenza casuale di caratteri. Risale ad un classico della letteratura latina del 45 AC, cosa che lo rende vecchio di 2000 anni. Richard McClintock, professore di latino al Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, ha ricercato una delle pi&ugrave; oscure parole latine, consectetur, da un passaggio del Lorem Ipsum e ha scoperto tra i vari testi in cui &egrave; citata, la fonte da cui &egrave; tratto il testo, le sezioni 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 del \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" di Cicerone. Questo testo &egrave; un trattato su teorie di etica, molto popolare nel Rinascimento. La prima riga del Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", &egrave; tratta da un passaggio della sezione 1.10.32.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Il brano standard del Lorem Ipsum usato sin dal sedicesimo secolo &egrave; riprodotto qui di seguito per coloro che fossero interessati. Anche le sezioni 1.10.32 e 1.10.33 del \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" di Cicerone sono riprodotte nella loro forma originale, accompagnate dalla traduzione inglese del 1914 di H. Rackham.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>Perch&egrave; lo utilizziamo?</h2>\r\n<p>&Egrave; universalmente riconosciuto che un lettore che osserva il layout di una pagina viene distratto dal contenuto testuale se questo &egrave; leggibile. Lo scopo dell&rsquo;utilizzo del Lorem Ipsum &egrave; che offre una normale distribuzione delle lettere (al contrario di quanto avviene se si utilizzano brevi frasi ripetute, ad esempio &ldquo;testo qui&rdquo;), apparendo come un normale blocco di testo leggibile. Molti software di impaginazione e di web design utilizzano Lorem Ipsum come testo modello. Molte versioni del testo sono state prodotte negli anni, a volte casualmente, a volte di proposito (ad esempio inserendo passaggi ironici).</p>\r\n<h2>Dove posso trovarlo?</h2>\r\n<p>Esistono innumerevoli variazioni dei passaggi del Lorem Ipsum, ma la maggior parte hanno subito delle variazioni del tempo, a causa dell&rsquo;inserimento di passaggi ironici, o di sequenze casuali di caratteri palesemente poco verosimili. Se si decide di utilizzare un passaggio del Lorem Ipsum, &egrave; bene essere certi che non contenga nulla di imbarazzante. In genere, i generatori di testo segnaposto disponibili su internet tendono a ripetere paragrafi predefiniti, rendendo questo il primo vero generatore automatico su intenet. Infatti utilizza un dizionario di oltre 200 vocaboli latini, combinati con un insieme di modelli di strutture di periodi, per generare passaggi di testo verosimili. Il testo cos&igrave; generato &egrave; sempre privo di ripetizioni, parole imbarazzanti o fuori luogo ecc.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Il passaggio standard del Lorem Ipsum, utilizzato sin dal sedicesimo secolo</h3>\r\n<div id=\"Translation\">\r\n<p>\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\"</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', '1', NULL, 'admin', '2022-10-21 06:09:02', '2022-10-21 06:09:02'),
(2, 'What Is A Parrot?', 'Education', 'what-is-a-parrot', '20221022093305.png', '<h2 class=\"species-sub\">What Is A Parrot?</h2>\r\n<p>Parrots are birds of all colors that usually originate from a warm habitat &mdash; think rainforests, grasslands, savannas, semi-arid regions, and even islands. A few species buck this trend and prefer colder climates, such as the Kea parrot, which inhabits the alpine regions of the South Island of New Zealand. Parrots are so much more than the stereotypical pirate &ldquo;accessory&rdquo; often portrayed in movies, books and other media. Most parrots are wild, but people began keeping some species as companions long ago. In fact, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/parrot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">San Diego Zoo</a>&nbsp;website states that the first written account of a captive parrot dates from 400 B.C. These amazing avian companions now span the globe, living in the hearts and homes of people everywhere.</p>\r\n<p>Parrots are not mammals. Their scientific classification puts them in the class Aves, order Psittaciformes, and the family Psittacidae. Parrots are sometimes called Psittacines. More than 350 species of parrots exist today. Add in the different varieties/mutations among the species, and what you have is quite a lot of parrots!</p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a parrot, a bird must have a curved beak. This is why they are sometimes called hookbills. They must also have zygodactyl feet, which means that each foot has four toes with two facing forward and two facing backward; a bit like the opposable thumb and fingers of humans. This gives parrots the ability to manipulate things so well with their feet.</p>\r\n<p>Although canaries, finches, doves, toucans, chickens, and other birds are kept as companions, these species are not parrots. These species are classified in orders other than the Psittaciformes of parrots.</p>\r\n<p>Companion parrots vary in size from some of the small 5-inch lovebirds to the large macaws, some of which can be 40 inches long, head to tail. Colors also vary by species. Some parrots sport numerous colors, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/species/lory/\">lories</a>, while others wear two or only one color, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/species/vasa-parrot/\">Vasa parrots</a>. And sometimes the male and female of a species look completely different, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/species/solomon-islands-eclectus/\">Eclectus</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Pet birds are very different from pet dogs or pet cats. These special souls bring a new dynamic into the lives of those who share their homes with them. To live with a parrot is a journey of discovery about these feathered friends and yourself.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/iStock_22259636AfricanGrey-256x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"300\"></p>\r\n<h2 class=\"species-sub\">Some Unique Traits Of Parrots</h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Besides their wings and feathers, a major characteristic of a parrot is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/bird-beak-inside/\">beak</a>. Parrots are very adept at using their beak, it&rsquo;s almost like a hand for them. They use it to climb, hold things, manipulate things, and, of course, to eat! Beaks grow constantly, and if a parrot&rsquo;s diet and habitat don&rsquo;t help keep the beak worn down, it must be trimmed to prevent overgrowth.</p>\r\n<p>Parrots have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/birds-live-long/\">long life span</a>&nbsp;compared to many other pet species. Small birds like budgies and lovebirds aren&rsquo;t considered&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/what-is-a-geriatric-parrot/\">senior</a>&nbsp;until 6 years of age, cockatiels aren&rsquo;t senior until around 12 years of age, and large birds like Amazons, macaws, cockatoos, and African greys aren&rsquo;t considered senior until they reach around 30 years old. And parrots of all sizes can live many years as seniors. This means that adding a parrot to your family is a commitment for many years.</p>\r\n<p>Parrots are birds, and female birds can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/the-female-reproductive-system-along-comes-the-egg/\">lay eggs</a>&nbsp;whether or not a male bird is present; eggs just don&rsquo;t hatch if unfertilized. Season and environment&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/4-easy-ways-to-deter-breeding-behavior/\">affect breeding activity</a>. Consult your avian veterinarian for information on what to expect regarding egg laying with your parrot&rsquo;s species.</p>\r\n<p>A bird&rsquo;s crop is a temporary storage pouch that&rsquo;s located along the esophagus between the mouth and proventriculus/stomach. The crop is useful, but it&rsquo;s also subject to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/crop-infections-in-birds\">crop disease</a>&nbsp;or impaction.</p>\r\n<p>Birds have feathers and feathers molt (shed). This means that new feathers are needed to take the place of lost feathers. That&rsquo;s where blood feathers come in. Blood feathers are actively growing feathers. They are shorter than mature feathers and have a softer shaft that&rsquo;s reddish, blue, or black near the base instead of being white. If a growing feather is bent or cut, it could bleed. Sometimes, blood feathers will break and bleed if a bird falls or thrashes about inside the cage. In this case, you&rsquo;ll have to pull the feather out from its root to get it to stop bleeding. Ask your avian veterinarian how to handle the situation if your bird suffers a broken blood feather.</p>\r\n<p>Wing feather trims must be done with care. Never trim blood feathers. It&rsquo;s a good idea to leave feathers on either side of a blood feather intact, which will help protect it.</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned before, parrots have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/parrot-feet/\">zygodactyl feet</a>. These allow them to grip and climb. Perches are important to parrot foot health. Providing numerous perches in and out of the cage with the proper diameter and various textures promotes good foot health. So, too, does keeping the nails trimmed. Regularly trimming nails also minimizes scratches you might suffer while holding your parrot. Your avian veterinarian or a professional bird groomer can perform nail trims or show you how to do it.</p>\r\n<p>The upper side of the tail of most parrots has a two-lobed gland called the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/your-birds-home/#Birdcage_Accessories_Lighting\">uropygial gland</a>, also called the preen gland. It&rsquo;s known to produce a secretion that parrots use in grooming. The secretion reacts with sunlight or full-spectrum light to produce vitamin D3 that parrots ingest during grooming. Vitamin D3 is necessary for good health. Some people speculate that the secretion also aids birds in differentiating the gender of other birds. Birds can make their feather water resistant by rubbing oils from their preen gland onto their feathers, which is why often see a bird rub its head on the base of its tail and then rub its head along its feathers. Parrots that notably lack a uropygial gland are Amazons and the macaws in the genera&nbsp;<em>Anodorhynchus</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Cyanopsitta</em>.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/why-birds-eye-are-so-different-from-ours/\">Parrots&rsquo; eyes</a>&nbsp;are laterally placed (on the side of their head), which gives them a larger field of vision but also creates a blind spot directly in front of their beak. They also have monocular vision, where only one eye is focused on a particular object. Parrots can also voluntarily contract their pupils (referred to as eye pinning), whereas our pupils and those of other mammals dilate automatically to light levels and some medications. Eye pinning can indicate a parrot&rsquo;s mood; rapid eye pinning usually indicates excitement.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"species-sub\">Popular Parrots</h2>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-4432\" src=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/iStock_6733984Budgerigar-300x199.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/iStock_6733984Budgerigar-300x199.jpg 300w, https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/iStock_6733984Budgerigar-90x59.jpg 90w, https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/iStock_6733984Budgerigar.jpg 425w\" alt=\"Budgerigar on wicker chair\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" loading=\"lazy\">If there were a popularity contest among the companion parrots, the top contenders would likely be cockatiels, budgerigars (budgies/parakeets), African greys, conures, cockatoos, Amazons, lovebirds, parrotlets, and those from the genus&nbsp;<em>Poicephalus</em>, such as Senegal and Meyer&rsquo;s parrots. Popularity could be due to size, personality, looks, vocalizations, or any number of factors. With so many pet parrot species, people can investigate and find the feathered companion who best blends with their home and lifestyle.</p>\r\n<div id=\"1\"></div>\r\n<h2 class=\"species-sub\">Native Region / Natural Habitat</h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The natural habitat of parrots varies by species, however, many hail from tropical or subtropical areas in South America, Central America, Africa, and Australasia. Parrots from the Americas are sometimes called New World and those from Africa and Australasia are called Old World.</p>\r\n<div id=\"2\"></div>\r\n<h2 class=\"species-sub\">Care &amp; Feeding</h2>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-556\" src=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/photo_greencheeked-225x300.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" srcset=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/photo_greencheeked-225x300.jpg 225w, https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/photo_greencheeked-67x90.jpg 67w, https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/photo_greencheeked.jpg 250w\" alt=\"Green-cheeked conure\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\r\n<p>A cage provides parrots with a retreat that they know is their territory in your home. It also assists in meeting your parrot&rsquo;s needs, such as controlling lighting; parrots ideally need 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness.</p>\r\n<p>The size of the cage varies by species. All parrots need a cage that allows them to spread their wings freely in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/transform-birds-cage-drab-fab/\">fully accessorized cage</a>. Species with long tails need cages that are tall enough to accommodate the tail length. Did you catch the phrase fully accessorized? You need to furnish your feathered friend&rsquo;s &ldquo;bird cave.&rdquo; Research the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/your-birds-home/#Types_of_Birdcages\">best cage material</a>&nbsp;for your parrot&rsquo;s species.</p>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.merckvetmanual.com/exotic-and-laboratory-animals/pet-birds/overview-of-pet-birds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Merck Veterinary Manual</a>&nbsp;offers the following general guidelines for size: 20 x 20 x 30 inches for budgies, cockatiels, lovebirds, or parrotlets; 36 x 24 x 48 inches for conures,&nbsp;<em>Poicephalus</em>, caiques, miniature macaws; 40 x 30 x 60 inches for African grey parrots, Amazon parrots, and small cockatoos; 48 x 36 x 66 inches for macaws and large cockatoos. Bar spacing ranges from 0.5 inches to 1.5 inches for the smallest to largest species. Keep in mind that these suggested sizes are minimum for a single bird, and a bigger cage is always better! If you choose to keep multiple parrots, be prepared to offer a cage for each. Sharing a cage usually only works for the same species, and even that isn&rsquo;t a guarantee that birds will get along. Never house birds together that show any aggression toward each other. And be absolutely certain you know the sex of your birds before letting any share a cage.</p>\r\n<p>Keeping the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/your-birds-home/#Cleaning_Your_Bird8217s_Cage\">cage clean</a>&nbsp;is critical to your parrot&rsquo;s health. Get into a regular routine of daily tasks like changing out paper and cleaning dishes and water bottles and weekly and monthly tasks like toy rotation and deep cleaning.</p>\r\n<p>Parrots groom themselves, but they need some help from you. Provide the opportunities for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/the-splash-about-bird-baths/\">bathing</a>, be it hanging out in the bathroom while you shower or misting water above their head. Turn on the shower and see if your feathered friend wants to check it out or splash in the sink with the faucet on. Besides bathing, other regular grooming your parrot might need includes beak trims, wing trims, and nail trims. Consult your avian veterinarian for recommendations on these for your parrot.</p>\r\n<p>Eating like a bird means different things to different species.&nbsp;<a title=\"Browse Parrot Bird Food\" href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-food/bird-species/parrot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Parrots</a>&nbsp;are mostly known for eating seeds, nuts, fruit, and vegetables, but most are omnivores rather than herbivores. And some, namely the lory, mainly eat nectar. Some species are more prone to vitamin deficiencies and some are prone to obesity. That&rsquo;s why a balanced diet is so important.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-food/bird-food/classic-nutri-berries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nutri-Berries</a>&nbsp;deliver a balanced diet that&rsquo;s also tasty and interesting to promote nutritious foraging.

These are snacks, so keep portions balanced for the size of your bird. Berries, bananas, leafy greens, and squash are some of the healthy foods safe to feed parrots. Some foods you might consider healthy are actually&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/healthy-foods-your-bird-should-stop-eating-today/\">bad food for birds</a>, so do your homework and consult your avian veterinarian about any foods you doubt the safety of for your bird.</p>\r\n<p>Where to eat might be as important to some birds as what to eat. Cockatiels, for example, are ground foragers and would likely prefer their food served on the floor of their cage. Find out the preferred eating style of your parrot&rsquo;s species.</p>\r\n<div id=\"3\"></div>\r\n<h2 class=\"species-sub\">Personality &amp; Behavior</h2>\r\n<p>Parrots can be loud or quiet, boisterous or reserved, problem-solvers or laid-back. Sound contradictory? That&rsquo;s because parrots are individuals with individual personalities. Some generalities among species are recognized, but keep in mind that any bird can be the exception to a generalization.</p>\r\n<p>Before jumping into species generalizations, differences also exist based on age. Young and immature birds that are cute and cuddly can become more demanding or even aggressive when they mature and breeding season arrives. And older birds might turn standoffish or needy, depending on the changes that occur as they age.</p>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/find-a-bird/\">Lafeber Pet Bird Selector</a>&nbsp;classifies companion birds into four categories of interaction:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/find-a-bird/?fwp_interaction_facet=highly-social\">Highly social</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/find-a-bird/?fwp_interaction_facet=social\">social</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/find-a-bird/?fwp_interaction_facet=somewhat-social\">somewhat social</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/find-a-bird/?fwp_interaction_facet=hands-off\">hands off</a>. The most species fall into the social category. Being social doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean a bird wants to cuddle, but your attention is a must. Highly social birds range from the intelligent and sensitive African greys to the almost needy cockatoos. The social species include cockatiels, budgies, several species of macaws, Amazons, lovebirds, parrotlets, and more. Let them know they&rsquo;re part of your family/flock, and all is well. The bird species that are hands-off according to the bird selector are actually not parrots. They are finches, canaries, and doves. Set them up in a nice habitat and enjoy watching and listening to them. Finally, the category with the smallest number of birds is the one called somewhat social. Rosella parrots make up this category. Consistent interaction with them keeps them tame.</p>\r\n<p>One thing that&rsquo;s common for almost all parrots is that they&rsquo;re messy. Eating for birds is an event, and they enjoy interacting with their food. That means food gets dropped, flung, squirted, and ricocheted. This is natural for parrots, and part of the reason that the nutritious foraging of Lafeber foods is such a bonus. It delivers excellent nutrition while encouraging interaction, and every bit is so tasty that parrots seek it out. In addition to food mess, bird droppings create debris. Some species, like cockatoos and cockatiels, emit a fine dust from their feathers. Put all of this into a cage where a bird moves around and flaps, and it&rsquo;s a recipe for a mess. But numerous inventions help minimize this and today&rsquo;s cleanup tools make keeping your parrot&rsquo;s cage clean quick and easy.</p>\r\n<p>Parrots are known to be intelligent, African grey parrots in particular, as documented by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/author/irene/\">Dr. Irene Pepperberg</a>. Never underestimate a parrot&rsquo;s ability to understand you, escape from an enclosure, or reach something the parrot wants. Opportunities for play and interaction are important for all parrots, whether with you or with another of the parrot&rsquo;s species.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/parrot-toys-what-to-chew-today/\">Toys</a>&nbsp;are critical for parrots, especially puzzle toys, foot toys, destroy toys, mirrors, bells, and more.</p>\r\n<div id=\"4\"></div>\r\n<h2 class=\"species-sub\">Speech &amp; Sound</h2>\r\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-5774\" src=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/YellowHeadAmazon-300x300.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/YellowHeadAmazon-300x300.png 300w, https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/YellowHeadAmazon-100x100.png 100w, https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/YellowHeadAmazon-90x90.png 90w, https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/YellowHeadAmazon-150x150.png 150w, https://lafeber.com/pet-birds/wp-content/uploads/YellowHeadAmazon.png 306w\" alt=\"Amazon parrot\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\r\n<p>One of the most endearing traits of parrots for many people is their ability to talk or mimic noises. Vocal ability varies among species, some are loud, others more quiet; some can learn to speak a human language, while others might only speak bird. Our Pet Bird Selector classifies birds into four categories: vocal communicator, chatterer, whistler, and relatively quiet. Some species fall into more than one category. Only one species is considered relatively quiet: the Vasa parrot.</p>\r\n<p>Possibly the best mimics of human speech are African greys, Amazons, budgies, myna birds, Indian ring-necked parakeets, and Quaker parrots. However, just because a species is known to be a &ldquo;talker&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean that a specific bird will talk. All birds are individuals.</p>\r\n<p>Most species are noisiest at dawn and dusk or when wanting to make contact calls with their flock (which could be you, the owner!).</p>\r\n<div id=\"5\"></div>\r\n<h2 class=\"species-sub\">Health &amp; Common Conditions</h2>\r\n<p>Parrots that are fed healthy food in proper portions, live in a clean, safe environment with plenty of room for exercise, and get plenty of interaction with their owner or other birds of their species enjoy the best chance at a happy, healthy life. Of course, not everything in life can be controlled, and genetics can affect the potential for some ailments. For example, cockatiels might be more prone to chronic egg laying problems, lories more often suffer from hemochromatosis, and Eclectus can suffer from toe-tapping/wing-flapping spasms.</p>\r\n<p>Following is a list of some of the health concerns that parrots face. Some are caused by nutrition issues, some by viruses or bacteria, others by parasites, some are injuries, etc. Consult with your avian veterinarian to learn which ailments might affect your feathered friend, signs to watch for, and whether you can do anything to minimize risks.</p>', '1', NULL, 'admin', '2022-10-22 04:00:48', '2022-10-22 04:04:20'),

Prides are family units that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Panthera_leo/\">may comprise</a>&nbsp;anywhere from two to 40 lions&mdash;including up to to three or four males, a dozen or so females, and their young. All of a pride\'s lionesses are related, and female cubs typically stay with the group as they age. Young males eventually leave and establish their own prides by taking over a group headed by another male.</p>\r\n<p>Males defend the pride\'s territory, marking the area with urine, roaring menacingly to warn intruders, and chasing off animals that encroach on their turf.</p>\r\n<p>Female lions are the pride\'s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/lion\">primary hunters</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/lion-pride-family-dynamics-females\">leaders</a>. They often work together to prey upon antelopes, zebras, wildebeest, and other large animals of the open grasslands. Many of these animals are faster than lions, so teamwork pays off. Female lions also raise their cubs communally.</p>\r\n<p>After the hunt, the group effort often degenerates to squabbling over the sharing of the kill, with cubs at the bottom of the pecking order. Young lions do not help to hunt until they are about a year old. Lions will hunt alone if the opportunity presents itself, and they also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animaldiversity.org/account\">steal kills</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/hyenas-myths-lion-king-africa\">hyenas</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/african-wild-dog\">wild dogs</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Threats to survival</h2>\r\n<p>Today, there are only&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/lion-numbers-halved-since-original-lion-king\">half as many</a>&nbsp;African lions than there were 25 years ago. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that fewer than 25,000 lions remain in Africa, which is why the organization classifies them as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/15951/115130419\">vulnerable</a>&nbsp;to extinction.</p>\r\n<p>African lions&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/15951/115130419#threats\">face a variety of threats</a>&mdash;most of which can be attributed to humans. Fearing that lions will prey on their livestock, which can be a significant financial blow, ranchers may kill the animals both in retaliation and as a preventative measure, sometimes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/poisoning-africa-kenya-maasai-pesticides-lions-poachers-conservationists\">using pesticides as poison</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/05/lion-poaching-the-brutal-new-threat-to-africas-prides\">Poachers</a>&nbsp;target the species, too, as their bones and other body parts are valuable in the illegal wildlife trade.</p>\r\n<p>The role trophy hunting plays is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/lion-trophy-to-be-imported-to-us-from-tanzania\">controversial</a>. Mismanaged hunting in the past has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/africa-lion-pride-reclaims-land-botswana-conservation\">caused lions to disappear</a>&nbsp;from some habitats, while hunters and those involved in the industry say hunting fees generate money for lion conservation. National Geographic Explorer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.org/find-explorers/craig-packer\">Craig Packer</a>, however,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/trophy-hunting-killing-saving-animals\">has said</a>&nbsp;the amount generated by hunting is so \"underwhelming&hellip;[that] it&rsquo;s no wonder that despite years of lion hunting being allowed in [some] countries, the lion population has plummeted.\"</p>\r\n<p>Further fueling this conflict between lions and humans is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/lion-numbers-halved-since-original-lion-king\">loss of prey</a>&nbsp;across the species&rsquo; range. African lions prey on large herbivores, a population that&rsquo;s being hunted for an increasingly commercial&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/bushmeat-explained\">bushmeat</a>&nbsp;trade. The IUCN&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/15951/115130419#threats\">estimates</a>&nbsp;these populations have declined by as much as 52 percent in East Africa and 85 percent in West Africa.

An application can be self-contained, or it can be a group of programs that run the application for the user. Examples of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/The-rise-of-modern-applications-Why-you-need-them\">modern applications</a>&nbsp;include office suites, graphics software, databases and database management programs, web browsers, word processors, software development tools, image editors and communication platforms.</li>\r\n<li><strong>System software.</strong>&nbsp;These software programs are designed to run a computer\'s application programs and hardware. System software coordinates the activities and functions of the hardware and software. In addition, it controls the operations of the computer hardware and provides an environment or platform for all the other types of software to work in. The OS is the best example of system software; it manages all the other computer programs. Other examples of system software include the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/firmware\">firmware</a>, computer language translators and system&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/utility\">utilities</a>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Driver software.&nbsp;</strong>Also known as device drivers, this software is often considered a type of system software. Device drivers control the devices and peripherals connected to a computer, enabling them to perform their specific tasks. Every device that is connected to a computer needs at least one device driver to function. Examples include software that comes with any nonstandard hardware, including special game controllers, as well as the software that enables standard hardware, such as USB storage devices, keyboards, headphones and printers.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Middleware.&nbsp;</strong>The term&nbsp;<em>middleware</em>&nbsp;describes software that mediates between application and system software or between two different kinds of application software. For example, middleware enables Microsoft Windows to talk to Excel and Word. It is also used to send a remote work request from an application in a computer that has one kind of OS, to an application in a computer with a different OS. It also enables newer applications to work with legacy ones.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Programming software.</strong>&nbsp;Computer programmers use programming software to write code. Programming software and programming tools enable developers to develop, write, test and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/debugging\">debug</a>&nbsp;other software programs. Examples of programming software include assemblers, compilers, debuggers and interpreters.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<figure class=\"main-article-image half-col\" data-img-fullsize=\"https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/itops-software_stack-h.png\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/itops-software_stack-h_half_column_mobile.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/itops-software_stack-h_half_column_mobile.png 960w,https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/itops-software_stack-h.png 1280w\" alt=\"Diagram of the software stack\" width=\"279\" height=\"427\" data-src=\"https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/itops-software_stack-h_half_column_mobile.png\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/itops-software_stack-h_half_column_mobile.png 960w,https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/itops-software_stack-h.png 1280w\">\r\n<figcaption>Here is a complete picture of the full software stack.</figcaption>\r\n<div class=\"main-article-image-enlarge\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</figure>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"How does software work?\">\r\n<h3 class=\"section-title\">How does software work?</h3>\r\n<p>All software provides the directions and data computers need to work and meet users\' needs. However, the two different types -- application software and system software -- work in distinctly different ways.</p>\r\n<h4>Application software</h4>\r\n<p>Application software consists of many programs that perform specific functions for end users, such as writing reports and navigating websites. Applications can also perform tasks for other applications. Applications on a computer cannot run on their own; they require a computer\'s OS, along with other supporting system software programs, to work.</p>\r\n<p>These desktop applications are installed on a user\'s computer and use the computer memory to carry out tasks. They take up space on the computer\'s hard drive and do not need an internet connection to work. However, desktop applications must adhere to the requirements of the hardware devices they run on.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/Web-application-Web-app\">Web applications</a>, on the other hand, only require internet access to work; they do not rely on the hardware and system software to run. Consequently, users can launch web applications from devices that have a web browser. Since the components responsible for the application functionality are on the server, users can launch the app from Windows, Mac, Linux or any other OS.</p>\r\n<h4>System software</h4>\r\n<p>System software sits between the computer hardware and the application software. Users do not interact directly with system software as it runs in the background, handling the basic functions of the computer. This software coordinates a system\'s hardware and software so users can run high-level application software to perform specific actions. System software executes when a computer system boots up and continues running as long as the system is on.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"main-article-image full-col\" data-img-fullsize=\"https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/whatis-system_software_vs_app_software-f.png\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/whatis-system_software_vs_app_software-f_mobile.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/whatis-system_software_vs_app_software-f_mobile.png 960w,https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/whatis-system_software_vs_app_software-f.png 1280w\" alt=\"Table comparing system and application software\" width=\"560\" height=\"392\" data-src=\"https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/whatis-system_software_vs_app_software-f_mobile.png\" data-srcset=\"https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/whatis-system_software_vs_app_software-f_mobile.png 960w,https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/whatis-system_software_vs_app_software-f.png 1280w\">\r\n<figcaption>Here are the key differences between system and application software.</figcaption>\r\n<div class=\"main-article-image-enlarge\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n</figure>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"Design and implementation\">\r\n<h3 class=\"section-title\">Design and implementation</h3>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/systems-development-life-cycle\">software development lifecycle</a>&nbsp;is a framework that project managers use to describe the stages and tasks associated with designing software.

After the initial&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/requirements-analysis\">requirements analysis</a>, the design phase aims to specify how to fulfill those user requirements.</p>\r\n<p>The next is step is implementation, where&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/feature/Top-10-software-development-and-test-tips\">development work</a>&nbsp;is completed, and then&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/software-testing\">software testing</a>&nbsp;happens. The maintenance phase involves any tasks required to keep the system running.</p>\r\n<p>The software design includes a description of the structure of the software that will be implemented, data models, interfaces between system components and potentially the algorithms the software engineer will use.</p>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/opinion/Who-is-responsible-for-software-development-and-design\">software design process</a>&nbsp;transforms user requirements into a form that computer programmers can use to do the software coding and implementation.

Nonfunctional requirements include portability, disaster recovery, security, privacy and usability.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/A-comprehensive-test-automation-guide-for-IT-teams\">Software testing</a>&nbsp;detects and solves technical issues in the software&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/source-code\">source code</a>&nbsp;and assesses the overall usability, performance, security and compatibility of the product to ensure it meets its requirements.</p>\r\n<p>The dimensions of software quality include the following characteristics:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"default-list\">\r\n<li><strong>Accessibility.</strong>&nbsp;The degree to which a diverse group of people, including individuals who require adaptive technologies such as voice recognition and screen magnifiers, can comfortably use the software.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/compatibility\"><strong>Compatibility</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The suitability of the software for use in a variety of environments, such as with different OSes, devices and browsers.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Efficiency.</strong>&nbsp;The ability of the software to perform well without wasting energy, resources, effort, time or money.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Functionality.</strong>&nbsp;Software\'s ability to carry out its specified functions.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Installability.</strong>&nbsp;The ability of the software to be installed in a specified environment.</li>\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/localization\">Localization</a>.</strong>&nbsp;The various languages, time zones and other such features a software can function in.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Maintainability.</strong>&nbsp;How easily the software can be modified to add and improve features, fix bugs, etc.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Performance.</strong>&nbsp;How fast the software performs under a specific load.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Portability.</strong>&nbsp;The ability of the software to be easily transferred from one location to another.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Reliability.</strong>&nbsp;The software\'s ability to perform a required function under specific conditions for a defined period of time without any errors.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/scalability\"><strong>Scalability</strong></a><strong><u>.</u></strong>&nbsp;The measure of the software\'s ability to increase or decrease performance in response to changes in its processing demands.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Security.</strong>&nbsp;The software\'s ability to protect against unauthorized access, invasion of privacy, theft, data loss, malicious software, etc.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Testability.</strong>&nbsp;How easy it is to test the software.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Usability.</strong>&nbsp;How easy it is to use the software.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>To maintain software quality once it is deployed, developers must constantly adapt it to meet new customer requirements and handle problems customers identify. This includes improving functionality, fixing bugs and adjusting software code to prevent issues. How long a product lasts on the market depends on developers\' ability to keep up with these maintenance requirements.</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/tip/4-common-software-maintenance-models-and-when-to-use-them\">performing maintenance</a>, there are four types of changes developers can make, including:</p>\r\n<ol class=\"default-list\">\r\n<li><strong>Corrective.</strong>&nbsp;Users often identify and report bugs that developers must fix, including coding errors and other problems that keep the software from meeting its requirements.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Adaptive.</strong>&nbsp;Developers must regularly make changes to their software to ensure it is compatible with changing hardware and software environments, such as when a new version of the OS comes out.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Perfective.</strong>&nbsp;These are changes that improve system functionality, such as improving the user interface or adjusting software code to enhance performance.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Preventive.</strong>&nbsp;These changes are done to keep software from failing and include tasks such as restructuring and optimizing code.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<div class=\"extra-info\">\r\n<div class=\"extra-info-inner\">\r\n<h4>Modern software development</h4>\r\n<p>DevOps is an organizational approach that brings together software development and IT operations teams. It promotes communication and collaboration between these two groups. The term also describes the use of iterative software development practices that use automation and programmable infrastructure.

The license outlines the responsibilities of the parties that enter into the agreement and may place restrictions on how the software can be used.</p>\r\n<p>Software licensing terms and conditions generally include fair use of the software, the limitations of liability, warranties, disclaimers and protections if the software or its use infringes on the intellectual property rights of others.</p>\r\n<p>Licenses typically are for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/1515785/Open-source-vs-proprietary-software-Getting-the-right-fit\">proprietary software</a>, which remains the property of the organization, group or individual that created it; or for free software, where users can run, study, change and distribute the software. Open source is a type of software where the software is developed collaboratively, and the source code is freely available. With&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/tip/5-common-open-source-software-licenses-you-need-to-know\">open source software licenses</a>, users can run, copy, share and change the software similar to free software.</p>\r\n<p>Over the last two decades, software vendors have moved away from selling software licenses on a one-time basis to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/Software-as-a-Service\">software-as-a-service</a>&nbsp;subscription model. Software vendors host the software in the cloud and make it available to customers, who pay a subscription fee and access the software over the internet.</p>\r\n<p>Although copyright can prevent others from copying a developer\'s code, a copyright cannot stop them from developing the same software independently without copying. A patent, on the other hand, enables a developer to prevent another person from using the functional aspects of the software a developer claims in a patent, even if that other person developed the software independently.</p>\r\n<p>In general, the more technical software is, the more likely it can be patented. For example, a software product could be granted a patent if it creates a new kind of database structure or enhances the overall performance and function of a computer.</p>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"section main-article-chapter\" data-menu-title=\"History of software\">\r\n<h3 class=\"section-title\">History of software</h3>\r\n<p>The term&nbsp;<em>software</em>&nbsp;was not used until the late 1950s. During this time, although different types of programming software were being created, they were typically not commercially available. Consequently, users -- mostly scientists and large enterprises -- often had to write their own software.</p>\r\n<p>The following is a brief timeline of the history of software:</p>\r\n<ul class=\"default-list\">\r\n<li><strong>June 21, 1948.</strong>&nbsp;Tom Kilburn, a computer scientist, writes the world\'s first piece of software for the Manchester Baby computer at the University of Manchester in England.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Early 1950s.</strong>&nbsp;General Motors creates the first OS, for the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine. It is called General Motors Operating System, or GM OS.</li>\r\n<li><strong>1958.</strong>&nbsp;Statistician John Tukey coins the word&nbsp;<em>software</em>&nbsp;in an article about computer programming.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Late 1960s.</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/diskette\">Floppy disks</a>&nbsp;are introduced and are used in the 1980s and 1990s to distribute software.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Nov. 3, 1971.</strong>&nbsp;AT&amp;T releases the first edition of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/Unix\">Unix</a>&nbsp;OS.</li>\r\n<li><strong>1977.</strong>&nbsp;Apple releases the Apple II and consumer software takes off.</li>\r\n<li><strong>1979.</strong>&nbsp;VisiCorp releases VisiCalc for the Apple II, the first spreadsheet software for personal computers.</li>\r\n<li><strong>1981.</strong>&nbsp;Microsoft releases&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/definition/MS-DOS\">MS-DOS</a>, the OS on which many of the early IBM computers ran. IBM begins selling software, and commercial software becomes available to the average consumer.</li>\r\n<li><strong>1980s.</strong>&nbsp;Hard drives become standard on PCs, and manufacturers start bundling software in computers.</li>\r\n<li><strong>1983.</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/free-software\">free software</a>&nbsp;movement is launched with Richard Stallman\'s GNU (GNU is not Unix) Linux project to create a Unix-like OS with source code that can be freely copied, modified and distributed.</li>\r\n<li><strong>1984.</strong>&nbsp;Mac OS is released to run Apple\'s Macintosh line.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Mid-1980s.</strong>&nbsp;Key software applications, including AutoDesk AutoCAD, Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, are released.</li>\r\n<li><strong>1985.</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchwindowsserver/definition/Windows\">Microsoft Windows</a>&nbsp;1.0 is released.</li>\r\n<li><strong>1989.</strong>&nbsp;CD-ROMs become standard and hold much more data than floppy disks. Large software programs can be distributed quickly, easily and relatively inexpensively.</li>\r\n<li><strong>1991.</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2009/08/0825-torvalds-starts-linux/\">Linux kernel</a>, the basis for the open source Linux OS, is released.</li>\r\n<li><strong>1997.</strong>&nbsp;DVDs are introduced and able to hold more data than CDs, making it possible to put bundles of programs, such as the Microsoft Office Suite, onto one disk.</li>\r\n<li><strong>1999.</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/definition/Salesforcecom\">Salesforce.com</a>&nbsp;uses cloud computing to pioneer software delivery over the internet.</li>\r\n<li><strong>2000.</strong>&nbsp;The term software as a service (SaaS) comes into vogue.</li>\r\n<li><strong>2007.</strong>&nbsp;IPhone is launched and mobile applications begin to take hold.</li>\r\n<li><strong>2010 to the present.</strong>&nbsp;DVDs are becoming obsolete as users buy and download software from the internet and the cloud. Vendors move to subscription-based models and SaaS has become common.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</section>', '1', NULL, 'admin', '2022-10-22 04:40:52', '2022-10-22 04:40:52');
